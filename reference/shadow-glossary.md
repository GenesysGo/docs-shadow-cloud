# Shadow Glossary

**Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT):** aBFT is a consensus algorithm used to provide fault tolerance for distributed systems within asynchronous networks. It is based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm and guarantees that, when properly configured and given tolerable network conditions, its consensus will eventually be reached — even when faults such as computer crashes, perfect cyber-attacks, or malicious manipulation have happened. aBFT is designed to be tolerant of malicious or faulty actors even when those actors make up more than one-third of the nodes inside the network.\
\
**Blockchain:** A peer to peer, decentralized, immutable digital ledger used to securely and efficiently store data that is permanently linked and secured using cryptography.\
\
**Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: A fault-tolerance system in distributed computing systems where multiple replicas are used to reach consensus, such that any faulty nodes can be tolerated and the consensus of the system can be maintained despite errors or malicious attacks.\
\
**Consensus Algorithm**: A consistency algorithm is a method of achieving agreement on a single data value across distributed systems. It is typically used in blockchain networks to arrive at a common data state and ensure consensus across network participants. It is used to achieve fault-tolerance in distributed systems and allows for the distributed system to remain operational even if some of its components fail.\
\
**Consensus Protocols**: A consensus protocol is an algorithm used to achieve agreement among distributed systems on the state of data within the system. Consensus protocols are essential in distributed systems to ensure there is no disagreement between the nodes on the data state, so that no node has a different view of the data. The protocols typically employ some form of voting, such as majority voting, or methods like proof of work, to achieve the necessary agreement on the data state.\
\
**Cryptographic Hashing:** Cryptographic hashing is a process used to convert data into a fixed-length string of characters, or "hashes", in order to protect the data and verify its authenticity through an encrypted code. The hash cannot be reversed to the original data and is used extensively time to ensure data integrity. Cryptographic hashes can be used to verify data integrity, authenticate data sources, and prevent tampering.\
\
**Cryptography**: The practice and study of techniques used to secure communication, data, and systems by transforming them into an unreadable format. Cryptography is an important component of cybersecurity, providing data protection and confidentiality.\
\
**Data Caching**: Data caching is a software engineering technique that stores frequently accessed or computational data in a cache in order to quickly access that data when it is needed. Data caching works by temporarily storing data to serve it quickly when requested. This can significantly improve the performance of applications, which reduces the amount of time spent serving requests.\
\

**Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS):** Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) is a consensus mechanism used in some blockchain networks. It works by allowing token holders to vote for a “delegate” of their choice to validate transactions and produce new blocks on their behalf. Delegates are rewarded for their work with a percentage of all transaction fees and new block rewards. DPoS networks are usually faster and more scalable than traditional PoW and PoS networks.\
\
**Digital Signatures:** A digital signature is a mathematical scheme for demonstrating the authenticity of digital messages of documents. It is used for authenticating the source of messages or documents and for providing the integrity of messages or documents. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message or document was created or approved by a known sender, and has not been altered in transit.\
\
**Directed Acyclic Graphs**: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a type of graph with directed edges that do not form a cycle. It consists of vertices (or nodes) and edges that connect the nodes.

Validators receive rewards for creating blocks and are penalized for malicious behaviour.\
\
**Proof of Storage (PoSt):** Proof of Storage is a consensus cryptographic mechanism which is used to attest to the storage of data in a distributed storage network. The consensus model requires a randomly chosen subset of storage miners to periodically provide cryptographic proofs that they are storing data correctly and that all necessary nodes are online. The goal of PoSt is to ensure that data stored is secure, as well as increase the security and transparency of distributed storage networks.\
\
**Proof of Work (PoW):** A consensus algorithm by which a set of data called a “block” is validated by solving computationally-taxing mathematical problems.

**Scalability**: The ability of a system to increase its performance or capacity when given additional resources such as additional computing, memory, data storage, network bandwidth and power. Scalability is an important consideration for developing systems that must handle increasing amounts of data, workload or users.\
\
**Secure Messaging**: Secure messaging is the process of sending or receiving encrypted messages between two or more parties, with the intent of ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the contents of the message. The encryption process generally involves the use of public and private keys, making it secure and nearly impossible for anyone else to intercept any messages sent over the network.\
\
**Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** A computer security framework that allows several parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs without revealing anything other than their respective outputs to the other parties. MPC leverages the security of cryptography in order to achieve privacy and security in computation.\
\
**Security Protocols:** Security protocols are systems of standard rules and regulations created by computer networks to protect data and enable secure communication between devices. They are commonly used for authentication, encryption, confidentiality and data integrity.\
\
**Smart Contracts**: A type of protocol that is self-executing, autonomously carrying out the terms of an agreement between two or more parties when predetermined conditions are met. They are used to exchange money, assets, shares, or anything of value without the need for a third party or intermediary in a secure and trustless manner. Smart contracts are used widely within blockchain-based applications to reduce risk and increase speed and accuracy.\
\
**Smart Contracts**: Contracts written in computer code that are stored and executed on a blockchain network. Smart contracts are self-executing and contain the terms of an agreement between two or more parties that are written directly into the code. Smart contracts are irreversible and are enforced without the need for a third-party.\
\
**State Machines**: A state machine is a system composed of transitioning states, where each state is determined by the previous state and the current inputs.

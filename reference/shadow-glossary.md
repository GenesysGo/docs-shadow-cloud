**Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT):** aBFT is a consensus algorithm used to provide fault tolerance for distributed systems within asynchronous networks. It is based on the Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) algorithm and guarantees that, when properly configured and given tolerable network conditions, its consensus will eventually be reached — even when faults such as computer crashes, perfect cyber-attacks, or malicious manipulation have happened. aBFT is designed to be tolerant of malicious or faulty actors even when those actors make up more than one-third of the nodes inside the network.\
\
**Blockchain:** A peer to peer, decentralized, immutable digital ledger used to securely and efficiently store data that is permanently linked and secured using cryptography.\
\
**Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: A fault-tolerance system in distributed computing systems where multiple replicas are used to reach consensus, such that any faulty nodes can be tolerated and the consensus of the system can be maintained despite errors or malicious attacks.\
\
**Consensus Algorithm**: A consistency algorithm is a method of achieving agreement on a single data value across distributed systems. It is typically used in blockchain networks to arrive at a common data state and ensure consensus across network participants. It is used to achieve fault-tolerance in distributed systems and allows for the distributed system to remain operational even if some of its components fail.\
\
**Consensus Protocols**: A consensus protocol is an algorithm used to achieve agreement among distributed systems on the state of data within the system. Consensus protocols are essential in distributed systems to ensure there is no disagreement between the nodes on the data state, so that no node has a different view of the data. The protocols typically employ some form of voting, such as majority voting, or methods like proof of work, to achieve the necessary agreement on the data state.\
\
**Cryptographic Hashing:** Cryptographic hashing is a process used to convert data into a fixed-length string of characters, or "hashes", in order to protect the data and verify its authenticity through an encrypted code.

Validators receive rewards for creating blocks and are penalized for malicious behavior.\
\
**Proof of Storage (PoSt):** Proof of Storage is a consensus cryptographic mechanism which is used to attest to the storage of data in a distributed storage network. The consensus model requires a randomly chosen subset of storage miners to periodically provide cryptographic proofs that they are storing data correctly and that all necessary nodes are online. The goal of PoSt is to ensure that data stored is secure, as well as increase the security and transparency of distributed storage networks.\
\
**Proof of Work (PoW):** A consensus algorithm by which a set of data called a “block” is validated by solving computationally-taxing mathematical problems.

The encryption process generally involves the use of public and private keys, making it secure and nearly impossible for anyone else to intercept any messages sent over the network.\
\
**Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** A computer security framework that allows several parties to jointly compute a function over their private inputs without revealing anything other than their respective outputs to the other parties. MPC leverages the security of cryptography in order to achieve privacy and security in computation.\
\
**Security Protocols:** Security protocols are systems of standard rules and regulations created by computer networks to protect data and enable secure communication between devices. They are commonly used for authentication, encryption, confidentiality and data integrity.\

## **The Basics of ShdwDrive**

The Shdw Ecosystem is a series of trustless infrastructure layers focused on a path to decentralizing the traditional cloud storage stack. Using distributed ledger technology, ShdwDrive will take advantage of high-powered traditional and mobile compute in order reducing costs of enterprise grade data center storage. We call this core technology D.A.G.G.E.R.

Powered by Shdw Operators, the network provides builders and businesses with storage and compute solutions to optionally expand their web3 presence, or just simply use some of the most highly performant distributed ledger technology for its low cost and resiliency in business.

Now cloud makes up $400,000,000,000 (that's billion with a B) per year business, and is expected to increase by another $1T by 2030.

The ShdwDrive Platform is a stable high-performance cloud storage platform on a path to be fully powered by a decentralized network of operators. Unlike traditional cloud storage platforms, network-generated revenues are sent to Shdw Operators. The ShdwDrive Platform is the only commodity cloud storage network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud storage platforms without sacrificing performance.

In order to execute this trustless decentralized network, we built our own highly performant consensus and orchestration protocol called D.A.G.G.E.R.

## **D.A.G.G.E.R.**

At the heart of the Shdw Ecosystem lies D.A.G.G.E.R., a trustless decentralized consensus protocol that extends ShdwDrive's capabilities beyond typical data-center offerings. It enables decentralized compute, mobile compute, and storage, all while maintaining high performance, quality, and security. D.A.G.G.E.R. is characterized by its asynchronous, leaderless consensus, efficient bandwidth usage, and flexibility in supporting both permissioned and permissionless deployments.

Learn about D.A.G.G.E.R.:

* Explore the full potential of D.A.G.G.E.R. through our [Litepaper](https://github.com/GenesysGo/dagger-litepaper/blob/main/DAGGER-Litepaper.pdf).
* Participate in our [Testnet](https://dagger-hammer.shadow.cloud/) and run a [Wield Node](https://docs.shdwdrive.com/wield) to experience D.A.G.G.E.R. firsthand.

## **Storage**

ShdwDrive integrates open-source, software-defined object storage with Solanaâ€™s Proof of History consensus mechanism and decentralizes it, achieving remarkable I/O speeds, scalability, and data integrity. ShdwDrive's v2 implementation of D.A.G.G.E.R. will ultimately result in a permissionless, trustless, and decentralized distributed storage network, driven by community participation.

The current [design](design.md#present-design-considerations) of ShdwDrive makes embedding storage into applications easy, robust, and natively interfaced into the Solana blockchain. The SDKs support [Javascript](../build/the-sdk/sdk-javascript.md), [Rust](../build/the-sdk/sdk-rust.md), and [Python ](../build/the-sdk/sdk-python.md)all on top of fast and reliable API. If you are building an application in need of back-end storage, secondary storage, or a client-facing storage option then our robust [Javascript SDK](../build/the-sdk/sdk-javascript.md) has you covered. For all use cases, we are focused on making fast and reliable storage incredibly easy to build with.

## **Compute**

Utilizing _D.A.G.G.E.R._ as an orchestration / oracle protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized resources (Shdw Operator virtual machines) under a front end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is similar in concept as an Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operated trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shdw Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future. We revealed this technology at the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event. With over 2,000 attendees we opened showcased live demonstrations of trustless virtual machine provisioning powered by a decentralized group of micro-clouds. Developers were able to build on these virtual machines for the span of the conference, experiencing first hand the exciting direction our platform is headed.

As mobile compute power and data speeds surge, we're developing _D.A.G.G.E.R._'s permissionless mobile compute and storage through the early-stage Solana Saga Mobile. This enhancement supports our existing ecosystem of builders using ShdwDrive in mobile apps. _D.A.G.G.E.R._ Mobile will bring distributed ledger technology for compute and storage to smartphones amid growing AI and gaming demands. We aim to make _D.A.G.G.E.R._, including ShdwDrive and mobile implementations, a practical choice for mobile and edge AI solutions, aligning with our roadmap.

## **Roadmap**

GenesysGo's development roadmap is meticulously structured around key milestones that are integral to the evolution of ShdwDrive, powered by D.A.G.G.E.R. technology. Our condensed roadmap highlights the strategic phases of development:

## **Shdw Operators**

**(currently in Testnet Phase 1)**

Shdw Operators are the decentralized backbone of the ShdwDrive storage platform. Operators lease their high-performance compute, storage, and bandwidth. Businesses, projects, and/or individual developers can trustlessly provision network resources. User payments are sent directly to Shdw Operators. Shdw Operators who ensure their resources are always available and performant earn more. Shdw Operators who are inconsistent earn less.

At the foundation of everything are the Shdw Operators who run the nodes that power the Shdw Platform. Operators can connect new nodes to the network, manage their existing servers, or view the overall status of other Shdw Operators â€“ all through the one easy-to-use portal.

Currently in development are a series of Shdw Operator node roles including Wield Nodes, Metadata Nodes, and Auditor Nodes. These roles work together under the orchestration of _D.A.G.G.E.R._ to form a permissionless distributed platform that supports both ShdwDrive services and mobile storage being developed.

#### Testnet Phase 1:

[Operating](../operate/) a shdwNode will allow you to trustlessly participate in the D.A.G.G.E.R. phase 1 testnet which powers the D.A.G.G.E.R. Hammer interface located [here](https://dagger-hammer.shdwdrive.com/). We encourage node operators to review our blog articles for full context on the role of Wield Nodes and the purpose of D.A.G.G.E.R. Hammer.

Wield Node operators will be handling thousands of live user test transactions and trustlessly executing all modules within D.A.G.G.E.R. that are requires to erasure code and store files uploaded to the Hammer test interface.

#### Testnet Phase 2:

Launching January 16th
